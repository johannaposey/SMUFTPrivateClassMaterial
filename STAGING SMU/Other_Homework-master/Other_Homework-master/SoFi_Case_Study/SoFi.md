# Social Finance - Case Study on a Unicorn in Wealth Management

## Overview and Origin

* What is the name of the company?

Social Finance, Inc.

* When was the company incorporated?

The company was incorporated in 2011. (Our Story: Sofi, 2020)

* Who Founded the company?

The company was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Ian Brady, Dan Macklin and Jim Finnigan. (Kadlec, 2020)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 

SoFi was founded by a group of students at Stanford University Graduate School in 2011 who sought to change the student loan industry. 
Through use of emerging technology and social media platforms, SoFi sought to provide community members the opportunity to invest in the success of the community, and provide engagement with student development all while lowering loan costs for students. (Social Finance Inc., 2020)

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

A trial run for the company was conducted at Harvard in 2011. The company was seeded with $2 million from alumni. The preliminary SoFi group offered approximately 85 loans to existing students. (Kadlec, 2020)

By September of 2012, they raised $77.2 million in Series B funding through a funding round led by Baseline Ventures, DC, and Renren, a social networking site in China. (Empson, 2012)


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 

The mission statement suggests the company is ultimately trying to help people gain financial independence. 

SoFi does not seek to define financial independence. Instead, they put it on the member to define the term for themselves through goals that reflect individual financial goals, be that living debt free, or having the independence to purchase a first home. (Our Story: Sofi, 2020)

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

According to founding member, Mike Cagney in 2017, the average consumer was 35 years old. (Gurdus, 2020) This makes the intended customer a millennial.

Data on the number of millennials in the United States varies greatly. This percentage is dependent on the age bracket used to define millennials. They appear to vary greatly among data sets. 

For the purpose of this paper, we will consider the millennial generation to encompass those born between 1981 and 1996. 

Millennials comprise approximately 22% of the US population. (Statista, 2020) At 75 million plus (U.S. citizens only), millennials are beginning to eclipse baby boomers. 

![Information Sources When Shopping, Statistista 2020](https://github.com/AnnSweetNanners/Other_Homework/blob/master/SoFi_Case_Study/Images/Annotation%202020-07-28%20134352.png)


The millennial generation is one of the most diverse both racially and ethnically. Millennials are more educated than prior generations and are getting married later in life. Additionally, millennials are also less likely to own a home, and were more likely to be in poverty than other generations at similar ages. (Frey, 2018)

Millennials are cautions with money. Across all articles/studies read regarding millennials and spending habits, research, be it online or word of mouth, was important before making a purchase. Before consuming goods and services, millennials often research, test products in stores, and seek out reviews.

While underemployed and in student loan debt, millennials are likely to increase wealth over time. (Page, 2020)

Millennials are more active than prior generations on social media, which affects the information they look for when shopping. The way millennials search for information (online vs guidance from friends/family) varied by product category. (Helms, et al., 2020)

![Population Distribution in the United States in 2019, by generation, Helms, et al., 2020](https://github.com/AnnSweetNanners/Other_Homework/blob/master/SoFi_Case_Study/Images/Figure%202.png)

Millennials are driving the growth of online shopping. As millennials enter the family stage of life, many online shopping with goods delivered directly to their homes or curbside. Also preferred, subscription services for certain categories, ex: Diapers, wipes, dog food, meal kits, and toilet paper. Millennials are also active mobile buyers, making 40% of purchases from a mobile phone. (Helms, et al., 2020) (Helms, et al., 2020)

While value is important in the age group (millennials being more likely to shop value channels than promotion), Millennials care about social responsibility, and are willing to pay more for sustainable offerings. They are also spending more than expected on products with health and wellness claims, ex “Organic, natural, GMO free, probiotic, nut free.”

*What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

SoFi builds connections.

These connections translate to favorable savings or asset growth for their clients, and for the business itself.

The company was founded to capitalize on the student loan bubble, providing lower cost loan options to students, offering income-based student loans with rates lower than Federal loans. Since that time, SoFi has diversified their product offering. While initially they may have been categorized as a student lender, they now are a full-fledged wealth management company having added student loan re-financing, mortgage loans, personal loans, corporate/workplace benefits programs, cash management accounts, and invest brokerage accounts to their offerings. They also offer insurance and estate planning through an affiliation with Ladder. (Our Story: Sofi, 2020)

At the crux, it seems SoFi is attempting to connect people in the same way as social media. They seek to connect those that want to invest in themselves with those that have the means to do so. 

Consider the student loan program; Providers and borrowers are matched by school. SoFi then pools loans, offering a lower risk investment to financers. 

Universities appreciate the loan program because it incentivizes alumni to invest time in student careers. Investing in student careers further ensures investors will receive their loan repayments. Students get the funds they need, at lower rates (at one point close to 2% lower than federal loans), with the chance of a more solid start in their careers when they join the workforce. People are connected, and theoretically everyone comes out ahead. (Kadlec, 2020) 

The company has also built a marketing engine that combines brand marketing, direct response, and member events. Sofi’s most distinctive marketing tactic? Events like dinners, panel discussion, and wine tastings and career services offerings to its members. (Harris, SoFi Is Paying Top dollar To Acquire Its Prime Customers, 2018) The less conventional benefits are designed to, “encourage loyalty and increase referrals.” By demonstrating a willingness to invest in members, SoFi is building “stickier’ customers, while simultaneously increasing the value of its customers. (Harris, Inside SoFi's Exclusive Club For "Great" People, 2016)

SoFi recently added a Crowdsourced ETF to their investment lineup. The SoFi 50 ETF, previously indexed to top 50 large-cap stocks, are now based on the most popular stocks held by members on SoFi’s invest platform. Want to know what your friends/peers are investing in? The ETF now tracks the SoFi Social 50 index, a portfolio of the 50 most widely held U.S. equities among member accounts. Per SoFi, the ETF has outperformed the S&P 500 over 20% since last October. (Social Finance, 2020)


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Detailed information about technology used by SoFi is much more difficult to pinpoint.

Information about stacks was hard to come by. But, with very high-level information, and information about partners acquired, we can determine a couple of things:

1.	It would seem, that of late, when SoFi is entering a new Fintech domain space, they acquire other financial technology-based platforms to provide those offerings. All acquisitions appear to be with the purpose of allowing SoFi to expand into other fintech domains.
2.	It appears common for SoFi to purchase tech firms who are set up to meet future compliance/regulatory needs.
3.	From a review of limited stack information, it seems flexible, scalable, and open architecture is the focus. In the era of the cloud, it seems open sourced and cross platform technologies allow for quick development and provide easy to write, secure, web hosting.

According to crunchbase.com, SoFi uses 42 technology products and services in their stack. Of those named, HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery, SPF, Apache and LetsEncrypt. (Crunchbase, 2020)

8 Securities, a recent acquisition uses GSuite, Varnish, PHP, IIS, and .NET. (Stackshare, 2020)

Take for example, the purchase of Zenbanx in 2017. Zenbanx allowed clients to mobile deposit checks, and exchange funds in up to five currencies at any time, earn interest on funds, and transfer funds internationally for a flat fee.

Through the technology built by Zenbanx, SoFi was able to offer checking accounts, debit cards, and money transfer services, going from online lender to retail banker. (Harris, SoFi Edges Into Banking With $100 million Zenbanx Acquisition, 2017)As SoFi expands into investment offerings, the purchase provides the tech platform to allow foreign currency trading in the future.

Zenbanx completed transactions through a partner bank, providing FDIC coverage for its deposits. After the acquisition of Zenbanx and incorporation of its tech stack, SoFi filed for a banking charter with the OCC and shut Zenbanx down. (Lawler, 2017)

In April 2020, SoFi acquired payment software company Galileo for $1.2 Billion. The company connects banks to credit card companies through API’s allowing SoFi to further its product offering to clients. SoFi will offer Galileo clients expansion into product lines like lending. (Rooney, 2020)

More interesting, Galileo offers an open API environment, or sandbox, where potential clients can code and test concepts in a secure environment, troubleshoot, simulate real activity, and stress test. (Galileo, 2020)The acquisition may be designed to provide SoFi with the tech to develop their own open API environment, possibly making it more cost effective to provide more banking services in their current cash management accounts, or future deposit business if their application with the OCC is approved.

Most recently, SoFi has acquired 8 Securities, a Hong-Kong based FinTech offering, mobile only investing, robo-advisory services, and a social trading platform with zero fees. SoFi will now be able to offer 15,000 stocks and ETF’s to its clients, and have an international presence in another large, up-and coming Fintech space. (Chen, 2020)

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

SoFi is categorized as a Unicorn company. Less than a decade old, the company is valued at $4+ billion, and has crossed into several FinTech domains in its short time as a company.

SoFi began in the Deposits and Lending domain, primarily as a Student Loan provider capitalizing on the bubble that existed (and exists) in 2011. Slowly, over the next three years, SoFi expanded into the lending space, offering student loan re-financing, mortgage loans, and personal loans.

It has been recent (2019) that they expanded into the Deposits space, offering Cash management accounts. They also crossed into the Investments space, offering investment accounts.

SoFi has traditionally also functioned in the Market Provision space, essentially creating financial social networks. Many of their member services, new product offerings, and business acquisitions focus on the social side aspect of banking and finance.

With the launch of SoFi Invest in 2019 and a partnership with Coinbase, investors can now hold a crypto wallet and invest in three cryptocurrencies. 

Further acquisition of Galileo expands SoFi into the consumer Payments space offering back-end infrastructure. The acquisition of Zenbanx in 2017 may at some point deepen their payments business, allowing clients to pay/transfer crypto with the currency wallet technology.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Trends and innovations are listed by domain. It should be noted that some innovations cross domains and may be referred to more than once. Additionally, focus was primarily on the U.S. based companies.

1.	Lending:

Primarily, lending FinTechs have expanded access to credit among the “underbanked” or sub-prime customers and made access more affordable for consumers, matching or exceeding rates from standard loan issuers.

Additionally, individuals and small- business borrowers now expect seamless digital interaction and quick judgements for lending decisions.

 A less visible change, non-financial platforms are now an important source of underwriting data. (Deloitte, 2017)


2.	Deposits:

Banks no longer define what customers expect from banking services. The client experience, fostered by FinTech platforms, now defines the products banks offer to clients.

Banks now need to pivot faster and offer a wider range of platforms and services. Currently they are partnering more with FinTechs to offer these features instead of creating them in house. Examples of these platforms include peer-to-peer banking, digital wallets for online services, and mobile only banking.
Banks are now moving core systems to the cloud. Legacy infrastructure makes it difficult to meet client needs. (Deloitte, 2017)

3.	Investments:

Responsibility for investments rest less on the financial institution, and more on the client. Quick, easy access to personalized planning and advice is tantamount, hence the rise of robo-advisors and automated investment accounts. 

Scales and efficiencies offered by FinTechs have also forced down the cost of trading to clients. Fully mobile providers have been able to offer no cost-trading, something larger firms have been forced to imitate, resulting in a need for larger firms to change sources of revenue. Scale is now more important, driving consolidation between the larger firms. (Deloitte, 2017)

4.	Payments

More payment methods are available to consumers as purchasing behavior moves online/mobile. The introduction of mobile/online wallets offer customers a fully digital payment option. (Deloitte, 2017)

Innovation in this space finds payment ecosystems diversifying in different regions. A variety of FinTech’s offer multiple new ways of doing business including companies that offer mobile card processors, Bitcoin for payment of services, payment in installments, simplification of international transfers, online bill payment features (pay all bills from one site), etc. (Deloitte, 2017) (Schroer, 2019)

5.	Market Provision
There is greater access to products than there has ever been, with traditionally over-the-counter products offered electronically.

This means there is now a more complicated, and uncertain regulatory environment, but also holds the promise of improved regulation and improved economies of scale.

Market infrastructure providers are changing to stay relevant, EX: Zero commission trading, the introduction of robo-advisors, social trading, and increased access to Bitcoin/digital currency wallets, trading, mining, etc.

Across all domains, in the last few years there has been a shift to consolidation among companies, with decreasing number of new FinTech startups (except for the insurance domain), suggesting a maturing market. Once threats to the industry, more financial companies are teaming with FinTech’s to offer new products and greater efficiencies. (Deloitte Center for Financial Services, 2017)

![Fintech companies founded by year, 2008-2017, Deloitte Center for Financial Servies Analysis, 2017](https://github.com/AnnSweetNanners/Other_Homework/blob/master/SoFi_Case_Study/Images/Figure%203.png)

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

It should be noted that at this time, major banks, financial institutions, and traditional card services providers are still major competitors of all domains. While FinTech’s have taken a share of business, are traditionally more efficient, and faster to adapt, adoption of their goods and services (EX: Digital Wallets) is low in comparison to numbers in traditional spheres.

Lending: SoFi, Lending Club, Lending Tree, Rocket Mortgage, etc.
Banking/Deposits: SoFi, Ally Financial, Acorns, Chime
Investments/Trading: Robinhood, SoFi, Betterment, Wealthfront, Nutmeg, Acorn etc.
Payments: PayPal, Stripe, Braintree, Klarna, Transferwise, Zelle, Coinbase etc.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
SoFi has become a leader in the student loan space, re-financing $18 billion in loans. Given SoFi’s start, it seems fitting that this is the space its most known for. (Fuscaldo, 2020)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

With IPOs still in discussion, SoFi is currently a privately held company, as are the majority of FinTechs. Information about common metrics like Revenue and Net Income are not publicly released, and data sometimes tends to be stale.

Still, these companies measure success similarly to their counterparts in the finance and banking realm considering valuation, revenue, net income, operating costs, etc. 

Valued at $4.3 billion, SoFi appears to be a leader in the lending space (compared against Avant, Lending Club, upstart Network, LendingTree, and Common Bond.)
SoFi has the largest number of loans issued in comparison with competitors like Lending Club and Lending Tree with estimates in 2018 at $30 billion. (Craft, 2020)

FinTech’s commonly use funding rounds as a measurement, another lead for SoFi with $767,000 in its last funding round and $2.4 billion raised in total.

Social engagement is a large part of FinTech firms’ success, so SoFi also can be measured against competitors based on their social media presence and engagement metrics. SoFi appears to be leading lending competitors in number of Twitter followers, average likes per tweet, and percentage of engagement with tweets. (Craft, 2020)

Opportunities among lenders appears to be in Alexa web ranking, with Lending Tree and Lending club ranking higher, and employee ratings showing a rating of 3.2, the lowest among compared lenders. (Craft, 2020)

When looking across other domains (companies reviewed were Robinhood, Coinbase, Nutmeg, Chime, Klarna, and Zelle) payments, deposits, trading/investment management, SoFi does impressively well, leading the firms in estimated revenue and overall funding. Interestingly, SoFi falls behind in this space in social media engagement with Rrobinhood and Coinbase leading in the space with number of followers, tweets, likes per tweet, and engagement with tweets. SoFi also only exceeded Chime, Zelle, and Nutmeg in Alexa rankings. SoFi also had the lowest employee ranking of all reported firms. (Craft, 2020)

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

When considering the lending domain, the space SoFi is most known for, it leads the sector in loans issued ($30 billion as of 2018) when compared against other top, online lenders like Avant, Lending Club, Lending Tree, etc. 

However, being the leader in loans issued may prove to be a negative in the long run. There have been concerns over FinTech performance during the current recession. With significant numbers of American’s laid off, the growing concern over repayment looms large. 

SoFi has typically taken the conservative path in its issuance of loans, only offering loans to those with high credit scores. Still, SoFi’s success in cross selling high-dollar mortgage loans creates future uncertainty for the firm, as with most mortgage lenders, with forbearance protections from the CARES act in effect until at least March of 2021.

Product diversification into the deposits and payments space may proffer a barrier to concerns over loan stability, with SoFi boasting 1 million members, a number that has tripled since January and an increase of 300% in trading activity on its platforms. (PYMNTS, 2020) Additionally SoFi’s ability to garner private investment means it leads FinTech’s in total funding and may offer some cushion to whether the recession.

SoFi does appear to have opportunity with employee engagement. Having the lowest satisfaction numbers of all firms, is not a surprise given the widespread claims of sexual harassment, misconduct, and lawsuits that pervaded the at the firm in 2017. (Popper Nathaniel, 2017)

However, the firm hired a new CEO in 2018 and overall appear to have weathered the storm so far. 



## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)

Social Investment:

Impact investing has already become a popular trend among millennials. Millennials care about social responsibility, enough to pay a premium for it. If SoFi is to stay relevant in the future I would recommend:
1.	Continue to be vocal about investments in local social development. Everything environmental initiatives like LEED certified office spaces, and onsite company composting initiatives, to stances on social justice initiatives (and donations to these initiatives) like Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movement will become basis for how investors make choices regarding where accounts are held.
2.	Continue to offer products that allow the investor to invest in companies that hold these same values. 
a.	Tools that will make it clear and easy for the investor to determine what companies are held in a fund, what communities those companies operate in, how they invest in their communities, and specific social justice initiatives they financially support will further secure millennial patronage in the future.

Lending to Middle/Low Income:

SoFi has already announced plans to pursue more middle-income mortgage clients in 2020. With the data available to online lenders, products offered to middle income and lower income clients may help to secure alternative revenue streams. Using data like professional history, future career prospects, income, history of paying back/managing debt etc. makes it easier for SoFi to determine the “riskiness” of potential lenders and may afford them the ability to loan to communities that traditionally have been underserved. (Fuscaldo, 2020)

Robo/Human Advisors

SoFi has already implemented a hybrid robo advisory service. Algorithms allocate investments, but human advisors are available to consult with. The pandemic has taught financial firms that while online is beneficial, there an emotional component that is placated by talking to a Human. In the future, human advice is expected to be primarily for higher wealth management clients. As a result
1.	Banking and Finance AI’s will play a more important role for investors with lower asset values. Investment in and development of chatbots, predictive analytics, predictive risk management tools etc. will be tantamount to operational costs low, while still effectively answering investment and service questions while providing a seamless interaction between the client and the company.
2.	Though the baby boomer generation (current retirees) are not the target market, millennials as their children will be tasked with their care in the coming years. I recommend offering services that help assess questions about insurance, Medicare supplements enrollments, prescription care, and how to plan for aid in care for the elderly both financial care EX: Medicaid compliant annuities, and physical EX: Services for in-home dementia care. While they may not be needs today, many millennials will begin to have these needs in the next 10-15 years. Having information and products planned and in place would help to meet future needs.

Local Payment Solutions

Mobile payment solutions and non-traditional payments like alternative currencies have not taken off with the emergence of FinTech. Payment solutions will need to fit customers live which may lead to regional solutions, specifically in markets that are still developing and do not have mature payment systems. (Deloitte, 2017)

1.	Investment in/participation in foreign payment development may keep SoFi at the forefront of payments technology.
2.	Considering the target market and the affinity for online shopping, mobile wallets that offer discounts for subscription services are likely to do the best with millennials. This means partnering with services that promote health and wellness, and companies that offer subscription services on products like diapers and wipes, dog food, meal plans, etc. that are frequented by millennials.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Please note, before reading solutions keep in mind it was difficult to find comprehensive information about SoFi’s stack. Therefore, specific tech that SoFi is using may be easily able to pivot to the solutions below.

1. To deploy and implement a useful chatbot, SoFi would need a messaging interface or MAPI/SAS, natural language processing or NLTK toolkit like Python, use of machine learning tech like Pandas, inhouse chatbot logic or scripts and a database like to store information it learns.
2. Insurance FinTechs
To develop insurance comparison platforms, SoFi would need continued use of analytics tools and cloud tools, and open source programming languages, which its already set up to do. No stranger to underwriting, underwriting for insurance is a different beast, certain Ais like zest.ai, or underwrite.ai (outside the partnership with Ladder) would offer the ability to deploy compliant credit models easily, process data, modeling, documentation, etc. (Zest AI, 2020) 
3. To offer a successful mobile wallet, use of NFC data transfer technology or QR code generators that link the wallet to the terminal at checkout would be required.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Open source allows users to freely modify a work and easily integrate into a larger product, making it easy to fix broken code, and offer more security based on the number of people testing and fixing code. FinTech has been built on open source programming, which has allowed for quick development, and a more transparent data feed to clients.
