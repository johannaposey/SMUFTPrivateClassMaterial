# Homework-1
Given the constantly changing environment we live in, regulation is getting harder and harder to monitor. This is becoming even more so in the financial landscape, where more and more services are offered online, with more choices for people to manage their finances on their own and from their own computers, mobile phones, etc. Seems like more and more we are becoming a technology-driven economy, and more and more underground markets are springing up. Data breaches and cyber-attacks have risen, changing the way we deal with threats. The newfound speed of the services has left regulators in a constant catch-up loop, where they not only have to watch over what they know exists, but at the same time have to keep revamping themselves so that they won't be too late in case they are needed. This is where RegTech comes in.

RegTech, also known as Regulatory Technology, uses technology to manage regulatory processes within the financial services. There are many companies that fall under this category, such as {}. As is part of the trend of bringing services online, they help businesses comply with regulations in a more cost-effective way. 

    "Regtech tools seek to monitors transactions that take place online in real-time to identify issues or irregularities in the digital payment sphere." ("What you should know about RegTech", found on Investopedia: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regtech.asp)
    
RegTech uses technology that allows them to monitor in real-time the transactions that are occurring online. This way they can identify any irregularities that may occur.

# History of RegTech
Regulations seems to always be a step behind, with no rules coming into place until something has happened. In 2008, we saw what a mess this can entail in the financial system, where regulators were too far out of reach with the goings-on of the rapidly and always innovating financial system. The Great Recession uncovered regulator's shortcomings, and subsequently financial regulation was tightened. At the same time, more and more technological breakthroughs, and the internet becoming more embedded with every individual's lifestyle, meant a rapid increase in FinTech companies. 

    "The reliance on consumer data to produce digital products has led to concerns among regulatory bodies calling for more laws on data privacy usage and distribution." ("What you should know about RegTech", found on Investopedia: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regtech.asp)
    
There are many RegTech companies, and they all focus on different aspects of the regulatory environment. Some of these companies are Signzy, encompass, CUBE, IdentityMind Global, and REGIS-TR.


# REGIS-TR
There are many companies within the RegTech domain, and they all have their own twist on how they approach regulations. I will focus on REGIS-TR, a Luxemburg-based company. They are a European trade repository, and they provide consolidated regulatory reporting services. Founded in 2010, they aim for a future where transactions across various asset classes can be reported to a single company, where derivatives fraud as well as equity trades can be solved by the same entity, saving companies time and money, which at the end of the day are their biggest resources. In short, they are "looking to simplify regulatory reporting obligations for (their) customers as much as possible. We envisage customers only needing to report to one entity in order to comply with the full range of EU and European financial reporting requirements" (found on REGIS-TR website: https://www.regis-tr.com/regis-tr/about-us/vision).
As of 2019, they were focused on building a UAT environment, while also adding testing facilities for account opening, data processing, same-day response messages, and reconciliation testing, among other projects. They are constantly setting up new partnerships (they currently have partnered with 12) with vendors and infrastructure providers to be able to meet the demand from their clients who are constantly looking to reduce their reporting burden. 

# Recommendations
I would like to see REGIS-TR have a counterpart in the USA. A more streamlined regulatory environment would mean less lost claims, and would save time and money for those reporting an issue as well as those solving them. 
I guess it's no surprise so many of the RegTech companies I found were European by nature, given how much stricter they are when it comes to regulations. It also seems like their regulations don't change (at least not as much) with every new administration, and that consistency is key to a successful regulatory environment.

# Feedback 
Great topic! I haven't put that much thought into technology for regulation, so I am glad I got to read this!

A case study is an analysis of a single entity. As such, you need to provide more information and analysis of REGIS-TR specifically. For a through case study you may need a few more sources. I would also be curious about how you think social/cultural differences between European and US companies might affect the landscape for regtech companies - or something along those lines.
