# FinTech Case Study: **The Stripe Hype**

## Overview and Origin

  In 2007 during a break from college 17 year old Harvard student John Collison, and 15 year old MIT student Patrick Collison founded Auctomatic, a SaaS platform for eBay sellers to track inventory and traffic.  In the process of running Automatic the brothers quickly realized the hardest part of running an online business was processing payments between customers and businesses.  At the time Auctomatic was being created eBay already owned 9 year old PayPal.  PayPal's platform was adding to an already bottlenecked system by restricting businesses to a 21 to 60 day rolling reserve, holding up to 30% of a companies revenue for up to 60 days. In addition to PayPal's shortcomings setting up bank accounts between e-commerce companies and customers was still a multiday process with multiple fees and verification steps.

  In 2008 the brothers sold Auctomatic to Canada's Live Current Media for $5 million, and went back to Harvard and MIT to continue focusing on their degrees.  It was at this time they developed a seven line block of code to connect any ecommerce store with any payments company solving the problem PayPal was not able to solve.  In 2010

In 2010 Y Combinator invested an unknown amount to the brothers for seed money for Stripe. Stripe was marketed to the public as a block of code with no additional changes needed for the payment solution.  The following year venture capitalists Sequoia Capital, Peter Thiel, and Andreessen Horowitz joined Y Combinator and invested $2 million to Stripe during beta testing, ultimately leading to a public launch in September 2011.


## Business Activities:

Building software to manage payments between vendors and customers typically took an average of six months to develop.  Stripe was able to market their code directly to developers at companies like Lyft, Shopify, Airbnb, and Kickstarter allowing them to add it directly to their site to flow through Stripe's servies and expedite the payments process.  Stripe's simplistic use of JavaScript and Ruby makes it easy to integrate into any back-end service or API for faster payment processing.

Because of Stripe's simplicity regarding their code, pay as you go service, and marketing, advertised as "making it easy for developers to accept credit cards on the web" they are outpacing competitors like Adyen and Braintree.  Stripe has an additional advantage over these FinTech companies since they were able to get in the door quickly with big names like Lyft, Facebook, DoorDash, and Salesforce to name a few.


## Landscape:

Stripe has dominated the online payment processing industry.  According to Stackshare Stripe has integrated with almost 3600 companies and has been used by nearly 5800 developers.  Over the last ten years Stripe has integrated with online marketplaces for apartment leasing and rentals, online donation platforms, digital commerce, and online portals for sellling SaaS applications.  Stripe has the capablitiy to integrate into any platform that processes payments between two parties, and they are successful in testing their software in a number of new and different fields including, most recently, factoring.

In 2015 Stripe Relay was launched to allow for a 2-click order within a social media platform on a mobile device.  Stripe utilized data analytics to determine that while 60% of internet browsing on ecommerce sites was done on a mobile device, only 15% of transactions were occuring on mobile.  

In 2016 Stripe expanded it's business, and Stripe Atlas was launched and marketed directly to small businesses around the world.  This allows small businesses worldwide to affordably start a business, while giving them access to Stripe's payment processing service and incorporating them in the United States. "According to Patrick in his February 2016 launch speech at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Stripe, he explained, was targeting entrepreneurs from Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Asia. “A majority of the growth over the next ten years will come from underserved markets,” he explained. “That includes about 6.2 billion people we don’t reach yet, and that’s a huge missed opportunity.”"

Currently, Adyen has made strides to catch up to Stripe as their number one competitor.  Adyen has expanded its platform to offer a wider range of merchant payment options, with their main feature being their optimizable dashboard with the functionality to send and receive payments.  Until recently Stripe only had the ability to accept payments, leaving the market open for Adyen. 

## Results

With the launch of Stripe, Stripe Relay, and Stripe Atlas companies worldwide have been able to market and sell products to a far-reaching customer base. The brothers dream of "expanding the GDP of the internet" has come to fruition, allowing ecommerce to be available to small, rural places while directly impacting these communitites financially.

Stripe does not publicilly disclose it's metrics as it's a privately held company.  In 2018 IDC published a white paper analysis of Stripe 

"IDC’s research shows that Stripe customers are lowering their costs of processing online
payments by 24% with Stripe and are even more cost-effective (52% lower) than surveyed
organizations processing more substantial online payments volumes (>$5 million per year)."  IDC was able to measure these metrics by surveying companies who used Stripe SaaS and tracking their cost of development work to build platforms, management and support of platforms, and regulatory compliance and antifraud.

Stripe's pricing structure for all of their products Payments, Billing, Connect, Radar, Terminal, Sigma allow for further growth and reach.


## Recommendations

Stripe would benefit the payment processing marketplace by utilizing their current technology to create a more streamlined supply chain finance system between their vendors and customers worldwide.  Stripe's Payments platform has the capability, with some minor adjustments, to store data related to sales made by small businesses.  With API integrations linked directly into current supply chain management databases Stripe could automate orders, product tracking, and an all-in-one platform to further benefit their current customers. 

Only 10% of the supply chain finance marketplace has been satisfied with Supply Chain Finance Soltions, leaving 90% available for potential market growth.  It is estimated this industry will grow at a 20-30% rate until 2027. Entering this marketplace now would be beneficial for the longterm health and growth of Stripe.
